As this programming langauge was taken on entirely as a learning exercise and a  hobby, I am not expecting much interest to come to this project. However, if you are interested in this code base please send me a message though [my website](https://www.davidjonesdev.com/contact). I will try my best to answer any inquiry as early as possible.

Feel free to make any forks and do anything you want with this language. I'd be very interested to see if someone built something interesting on top of this or took this idea further. Thank you for any and all interest.
